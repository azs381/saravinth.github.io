         <strong style="font-size: 20px;"> Compressible shear layer dynamics of compression-ramp type geometries in high-speed flows</strong><br/>
         <p> The thermo-structural response of a high-speed vehicle at concave/convex junctions (due to shock-wave boundary layer interaction) is excited by the unsteady flow in the low-frequency spectrum. They overlap with the structural frequencies compelling the need to understand the causal mechanism of the fluid system. Unfortunately, the space-time decomposition of such flow features often requires a long runtime, and complex geometries, such as the cone-slice-ramp comprise a high-dimensional state space making it computationally intractable. The linear operators of local and bi-global coordinates are probed to extract the unstable modes and establish physical mechanism driving the fluid unsteadiness. <!--The baseflow is computed using STAR-CCM+ and the linear operators constructed using a production level code built in MATLAB for sequential computation. Extension of the framework to perform global resolvent analysis and parallelization is ongoing using C, MPI and MUMPS.--></p>

         <strong style="font-size: 20px;"> Fluid-thermal structural interaction of cone-slice-ramp in hypersonic flows</strong><br/>

         <p>    We explore the aerothermoelastic behavior of a complex geometry, i.e., cone-slice-ramp, in the air-breathing hypersonic regime. The objective is to discover the interaction mechanism of the multi-physics problem and develop reduced-order models for multi-disciplinary design evaluation and trajectory prediction. The challenge lies in resolving the \(10^9\) order of magnitude difference in the temporal decomposition of the events across fluid, and thermo-structural domains, which makes it computationally intractable to predict the aerothermoelastic behavior of a complex geometry of the entire flight trajectory (~\(10\) min). A partition-based explicitly coupled high-fidelity numerical framework is validated against the experimental data for FTSI analysis of the cone-slice-ramp. The results revealed a fluid-dominant one-way coupling for the high ramp angle case. Based on this, a simplified thermos-structural solver is developed based on heat equation (shell-element based FEM) and modal solver (Rayleigh-Ritz). </p>

         <strong style="font-size: 20px;"> Computational validation of the PSU AFTRF single stage high-pressure turbine  </strong><br/>

         <p> Efficiency of a gas-turbine engine is critical given its worldwide usage across several sectors. Its performance is directly proportional to operational costs, fuel consumption and environmental sustainability. Especially in aviation, even a \(1\%\) improvement will lead to savings in several millions of dollars. In this context, the tip leakage contributes roughly \(1/3^{th}\) of overall turbine aerodynamic loss. Therefore, the objective was to develop efficient tip designs to improve the design efficiency. Leveraging computational fluid dynamics, the computational model of a high-pressure (HP) Turbine stage at the PSU-AFTRF experimental facility was validated using steady-state RANS. The computational model was used to characterize aerothermal losses due to tip leakage, and secondary flows in the blade passage. <!--Various inter-stage interfacing methods (mixing plane, sliding mesh, and harmonic balance method) and boundary-layer transition models were explored.--> The location of boundary layer transition on the nozzle guide vane was identified as a key factor to accurately predict the tip leakage flow.  </p>

         <strong style="font-size: 20px;"> Design of a high-pressure ratio mixed flow compressor for small jet-engines </strong><br/>

         <p> We propose a single-stage high-pressure ratio compressor using first-order principles to address the surging demand in the small aircraft engine segment (1-10 kg/s). The design is optimized, validated and examined for the flow physics with the RANS-based CFD in STAR-CCM+. A design point pressure ratio of 5.83 with 75.5% efficiency at 3.5Kg/s was achieved within 0.4m frontal diameter (higher performance than existing MFCs in the open literature). </p>
